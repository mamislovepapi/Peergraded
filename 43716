  if (weekdays(x) == "Sábado" | weekdays(x) =="Domingo")
  {y <- "Weekend"} else
  {y <- "Weekday"}
  y
})
#Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

plot<- ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of
       steps") +
  facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(plot)
